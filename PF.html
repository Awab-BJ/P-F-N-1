          <P style="padding-right: 57px;">Green Tunisia is an ideal destination for anyone who wants to relax and stay away from the hustles of life and go through amazing experiences and endless adventures. Tunisia is one of the destinations people go to for more than two weeks because never two weeks will be enough time to discover Tunisia and to explore all the wonderful places in it and you will be tired to visit all of it before the end of the week so it would be better if you take a long time off to stay away from all that concerns you and go on that ideal trip. <br> Tunisia is famous for its soft sandy beaches. It is also known among tourists for its ancient archeological sites, the marvelous desert landscapes, the marvelous Islamic architecture, and many beautiful cities teeming with tourist attractions and interesting places that deserve to be discovered..</P>

      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="par">
          <P>This means that it is one of the most important tourist areas in Tunisia, and the destination of many flights is easy to find housing and food. You will not have to book anything in the capital before traveling. The Tunisian capital is crowded, beautiful, enjoyable and full in all respects, and it includes all kinds of market stalls and shops.<br>Perhaps the most beautiful part of the capital of the country is the walled Old Arab City, known as the city, where you will be able to discover wonderful examples of Arab architecture and vibrant markets that include all local products, from household goods to handicrafts. Perhaps you will live there through a wonderful experience that will take you back in a few minutes to the era of Arab wealth that prevailed from the 12th to the 16th centuries.<br>The ancient city spans more than 280 hectares and is home to more than 700 artifacts dating largely from the 12th to 16th centuries when Tunisia was one of the leading centers of the Muslim world, as seen in a range of Islamic designs in the form of mosques, markets, fountains, religious schools, military palaces and large gates.<br> Perhaps the most beautiful place to visit in the capital is the Bardo National Museum, which is full of amazing mosaics that will immediately catch your attention, in addition to ancient artifacts. This museum is an ideal destination for you if you would like to discover the history of Tunisia, between the unique architecture and the ancient civilization, and the Bardo Museum was once the palace of the King of Tunisia, and is considered the store of the historical civilizations that lived in the country.Another major attraction in the capital is the Zeitouna Mosque, the city's oldest and one of the most prominent tourist attractions in Tunisia.</P>

        <div class="par">
          <P>This destination represents one of the best places for people who do not like vast areas. It is a small place. Sidi Bou Said should be your next destination for the Tunisian capital as it is only half an hour away by train. What's so special about this place is that it's almost a replica of the Greek island of Santorini, and all the buildings are only white or blue, but it's much cheaper than that. Sidi Bou Said has another name which is City of Hills and besides being full of cats for cat lovers, you can't stop yourself from taking wonderful pictures everywhere.<br>Perhaps the most beautiful city in Tunisia is located on the top of a steep cliff overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The traditional splendid houses and a beautiful touch with flashes of bright blue add more beauty to this city which now attracts large numbers of tourists, who come to enjoy the narrow streets lined with cafes, art shops and unforgettable local souvenir stalls. The city also provides a wonderful base for exploring Roman ruins close to Carthage.</P>

          <P>Bizerte is a town in northern Tunisia located between the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Bizerte, about 60 km from Tunis, known for the diversity of its beaches (Rimel, Sidi Selem, Les Grottes...) but also for its historical sites. The city of Bizerte is the capital of a governorate with more than half a million inhabitants. The city had 136,917 inhabitants in 2014. Surrounded by the Mediterranean to the north and east, the lakes of Bizerte and Ichkeul to the south, the city communicates via a corridor to Menzel Bouguiba and Tabarka, and a mobile bridge that connects it to Zarzouna and then Tunis. The town of Bizerte is also known for its eclectic population, its medina by a small fishing port and its sandwich Lablebi, a typical Bizertine specialty.<br>The town of Bizerte was originally a Phoenician and later Roman trading post. It developed from the XIII under the reign of the Hafsids. Land of asylum the city hosted in the XVII the Andalusians, driven out of Spain under the Inquisition and the white Russians at the beginning of the century, some of whom still live in Bizerte.It became an important French military base after the French protectorate in 1881, given its strategic position. Evacuated in 1963, it remains marked by the mix of the populations that lived there.</P>

        <div class="par">
          <P>Beni Mtir or Beni Metir is a village in northwestern Tunisia located in the mountainous region of Kroumirie a few kilometers from Ain Draham.

            Beni Mtir is located on the territory of the confederation of Kroumirs Berber tribes. Located at an altitude of 650 meters and attached to the governorate of Jendouba.Beni Mtir is the least populated of the country’s municipalities with a population of 784 in 2014, mostly young people, living mainly in jobs provided by the Tunisian Electricity and Gas Company and the National Water Utilization and Distribution Company. She is attached to Fernana's delegation. <br>Built in 1948 to house the engineers and workers who came to build the Beni Mtir dam that the village overlooks, the village has retained its original and typical architecture following a municipal decree: tile roofs and identical façades with black shutters and red frames.A pilot project for a spa, supported by the European Union, is being studied in the context of ecological tourism thanks to the presence of a hot water source — called Hammam Salihine — which is, at 73°C, the hottest in Tunisia and one of the hottest in the world. It is known for its curative properties of rheumatic, inflammatory and epidermal diseases. <br> The first Council of Ministers held outside the presidential palace in Carthage in 1958 took place in the chalet that houses the offices of the municipality. In addition, this is where an orphanage was set up with the help of UNICEF.The village appears in Françoise Gallo's documentary Stessa luna (2006), which evokes a moment in the filmmaker's life in this village during the construction of the dam.

        <h1>Douz</h1>   
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="par">
          <P>The city of Douz is a small town in the south-central part of Tunisia. Considered ‘the Gate of the Sahara’. Administratively attached to the governorate of Kébili, it is located 488 kilometers from Tunis. It is a municipality of 30,245 inhabitants (in 2014). Its inhabitants are essentially ‘Mrazig’ who are traditionally believed to have been Arab immigrants from the Banu Sulaym tribe who arrived in Tunisia in the 13th century. <br> Vast oasis, guardian of the Grand Erg. Douz, like Sabria and El-Faouar, and a very old market square where sedentary and nomadic people gathered in the region. A rallying point for ‘Mrazig’ nomads, it has become one of the major tourist hubs of southern Tunisia. At the beginning of the 20th century, the village consisted of only a few buildings surrounded by tents. The nomads stayed in Douz during the hot months, leaving the camels looking for their water point. As soon as the heat was over, they set sail again, pushing their animals toward the winter pasture.Since the dawn of time, this is man’s best friend: the camel. This quadruped (a single hump) is tireless, highly adaptable to moving and transporting goods in hostile environments impossible for other mammals to get through. <br> In winter, dromedaries can last for months without drinking. When they find water, they can quietly drink 135 liters of water in 10 minutes. To get an idea of the different breeds of camel and to attend fierce negotiations, in Douz there is an animal souk that is worth the detour. So is the weekly Thursday morning market, where crafts are sold: Berber jewelry, beautiful rugs and shoes made of camel or goat leather, woven with colorful patterns on top of Douz’s emblem, very comfortable. This is also where you can buy the famous ‘burnous’ made of sheep’s wool for a reasonable price, and it is a rather heavy cape with a hood. The ‘burnous’ is made only by women, its manufacture lasts about a month. <br> The Sahara Festival of Douz, is the most famous of the festivals celebrating Saharan and nomadic culture at the international level (since 1967). Its main theme is the celebration of the heritage of the Arab-Berber tribe ‘Mrazig’. Its fame goes beyond borders, and friendly countries take part in the show (Algeria, Libya, Egypt...) , in order to also present their traditional music and dance. It is an annual event that animates the winter period and is recommended to live at least once in your life. Douz is a dream destination for tourists who want to discover the desert, either by camel or four-wheel drive. The city offers its tourists a multitude of hotels, ideal for an original holiday combining escape and relaxation. The people of Douz are known for their hospitality and generosity.</P>

          <P>Towns sprouting out of the desert and nestled against immense palm groves, Tozeur and Nefta surprise, fascinate and plunge into a change of scenery. The hot light of the Sahara Desert pours into the alleys of the old neighborhoods, between the high facades of blond brick. In Tozeur, palaces, theme parks and museums flourished around the old town. In Nefta, innumerable cupolas mark the tombs of saints, dominating the oasis that is lost in a bowl called the Recycle Bin. The Sahara dunes are just a few kilometers away... <br>The old neighborhoods of Tozeur and Nefta offer a very special face. Follow the alleys and covered passages that give a surprising feeling of freshness under the Saharan sun. Admire the sand-colored brick façades and their astonishing relief decorations. Then go to the giant oases, real palm forests in the shade of which orchards are cultivated. On foot or by carriage, enjoy the unique atmosphere of the palm groves. <br> The surroundings will surprise you with the variety of desert landscapes: mountain lines, arid plateaus, giant dunes, salt lakes sparkling in the sun. Cross the gigantic Chott el-Jerid, an ancient inland sea almost entirely dried out, covered in a brilliantly white salt crust. Follow the mountain oasis route - Chebika, Tameghza, Midès - and explore the canyons, waterfalls and palm groves nestled in the rock. Further to the north-east is the oasis of Gafsa, a city known for its Roman stone basins and brightly colored curtains.</P>
